What are bean scopes in spring framework 

singleton -> Only one object will be created for entire application
prototype -> For every bean, separate object will be created. 
request
application



1) Spring beans defined are by default

a) Abstract
b) SingleTon
c) Final
d) Initialized


SingleTon

2) What are the type of Bean Injections are available

a) Constructor and Setter
b) Constructor and Getter
c) getter and setter
d) Constructor, getter, setter

Constructor and Setter

3) What are the different autowire types

byName, byType, constructor and autodetect

4) What is BeanFactory and ApplicationContext

ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory


4) AOP Stands for

5) What is MVC stands for

6)Spring Provides

	Resource Management
	Exception Handling
	Resource unwrapping
	Abstraction for Handling large data


7) If the select methods singaure that matches with following pointcut
execution(* com.test.service..*.*(*))

What is AOP

	It is a paradigm that complements Object Oriented Programming while concerned with 
organize code into classes and objects. AOP focuess on cross-cutting concerns

functionalities that affect multiple parts of an application. 

Cross cutting concerns include logging, security, transactions 

1) JointPoint : Execution point of program. it will be method or handling exception. In Spring AOP jointpoint always represents a method execution. JointPOint Define the points in your application at which you can insert additional logic.

2) Advice : Is the code that will be executed at particular jointpoint

	BeforeAdvice -> THis comes for every method  before starting
	After Advice  -> This comes at the end of every method
	After Throwing Advice
	After Adive
	Around Advice -> This comes only for particular method. 

@Pointcut("execution(* com.hexaware.aop.Boarding.*(..))")

Means in Boarding class all methods with all parameters it will be applied
3) Aspect : Is the combination of advices and pointcuts in class, the aspect class can be
prefixed with @aspect annotation


How to give example for before, after and AfterReturning



@Pointcut("execution(* com.hexaware.aop.Boarding.*(..))")
	public void assignProject() {}
	
	@AfterReturning(
			pointcut = "execution(* com.hexaware.aop.Boarding.*(..))",
			returning = "result")
	public void myadvice(JoinPoint jp, Object result) {
		System.out.println("Additional Output");
		System.out.println("Method Signature  " + jp.getSignature());
		System.out.println("Result  " +result);
	}

	
	@Before("assignProject()")
	public void mcqExam() {
		System.out.println("Pleaes Check cleared all Mcq Exams are Not...");
	}
	
	@After("assignProject()")
	public void assignLaptop() {
		System.out.println("Please Provide Laptop");
	}

4) PointCut : is a predicate or expression that matches the jointpoints. 

5) Weaving

6) Target 
AOP Purely

AOP Architectuere

Advice, JointPoint, PointCut

Types of Adivces

How to start with Spring AOP


________________________________________________


Syntax to define aspect class 

@Aspect

@Before("execution (* EmployeeManager.getEmployeeById(..))") -- POintcut expression

________________________________________________________________


@Aspect

@Before(" execution(* com.hexaware.core.aop.service.EmployeeSerice.*(..))")

__________________________________________________________________________

In Spring AOP what is an advice 

Advice is methoed that handles cross-cutting concern

An advice action can be taken by an aspect for particular joint point. Joint POint is a method execution

Which type of advice runs aftrer the advice method completes without throwing any exception

After Returning Advice

In Spring AOP, what defines a point where an advice should be executed

All advices to be defined in pointcut

POintCut Defines the expressions that determine which join points (like method executions) should be matched for advice execution

What is SPRING AOP supports

	Only one method execution joint point
	Implemented using proxies
	Its integrated with Spring's transaction management

Spring AOP is proxy based does not use bytecode waving 

which advice will be executed even program success or exception thrown

1) After Advice 

Which AOP framework does spring AOP integrate with for advanced AOP features 
	AspectJ

which advise executes mandatorily irrespective of Program success or error

@After

How to auto-inject into a filed a bean by its name

How to create an object for ApplicationContext

ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathxmlApplicationConext("xmlfile");


<bean class="com.hexaware.Address">
  <property name="city" value="Hyd"/>
</bean>

<bean class="com.hexaware.temp.Address" ref="addr" /> 

Wrong as we have not given id to first bean


<bean id="addr" class="com.hexaware.Address">
  <property name="city" value="Hyd"/>
</bean>

<bean class="com.hexaware.temp.Address" ref="addr" /> 

Which annotation used for autowiring 

<context:annotationConfig />
