Web Application : These are the applications, that which are to be called from various places rather than where they are created. 

If you want to make any distributed or robust applications, 
then we need the help of web applications. 

You can create web applications in 2 ways as 

1) Scripting Languages

2) Programming Languages

Scripting Languages are langauges, that which are interpred
during runtime they takes lot of time to execute. 

Programming languages are langauges that which are compiled 
first, during runtime they takes very less time to execute. 

In Java, we can make web applications by using JSP.


Java Server Pages (Used to create any UI w.r.t. Web applciations)

The advantage w.r.t. JSP is 

JSP takes the combination of Java code and HTML together
that makes the application to run and performance will improve.

For running web applications, we need to use either any webserver

preferably we can use Apache Tomcat Web server. 

Web applications purely work on the basis of request and response. 

the main intrinsic objects we have in JSP are
_____________________________________________

request	-> Any resource or value we are requesting comes with request

response -> Any target we need to write

out  -> Any data we need to print programmatically

out.println("It will print on web page");

application

session

How to write java code in JSP page, 

we have predefined directives we have as

<%@ page %> : This directive used to add packages

<%@ page import="java.util.List" %> 

<%! %> : Used to variable declarations

<% %> : Used for scriptlet tags. used to write pure java code

<%= %> : Used to print values or expressions. (If any already existing values to be printed use this expression bracket)

JSP page no need to recompile, once you refresh the page it will get updates automatically.
