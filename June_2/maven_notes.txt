Maven is build tool, that which takes care of

-> External jar files

-> Plugins

-> Company Profile info

-> Coding standards etc...

before maven, if you want to configure external tools,
we need to add jar files to the given project. 

but that is highly tedious process as day by day the version
changes and lot of new plugins to be added the project 
becomes more heavier. 

To avoid this, we need the help of maven. 

Maven project is a build tool, that which takes care of

1) Dependencies (means any external jar files to be added)

2) plugins (Some companies will have built-in plugins to be 
configured)

3) Policy files to be added to the project. 

To create maven-project, 

for console applications, use the filter as

java-quickstart

for web application, please use filter as

quickstart-web

*** Maven creates the project structure clearly, as 
which code write to where and where to write test cases ***

Maven contains the properties as

groupId : means to which category it belongs like (junit or 
jdbc or MySQL etc)

artifactId : This is the name of the project we are using. 

The heart for maven project is

pom.xml which contains all the dependencies to be added for 
the given project. 
You can add the external jar files to the pom.xml file as
by adding Dependencies. 

For example, if you want to deal with MySQL, then 
 <dependency>
<groupId>mysql</groupId>
<artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
<version>8.0.15</version>
</dependency>

add the dependency after 17 line if it is console app

Now, sameway if you want to add Lombok dependency, then 

Maven will have 3 repositories knwon as

1) Local Repo : It is the repository which is there in ur users
folder named as .m2 

2) Central Repo : It is there in the env.
https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/archetype-catalog.xml

3) Remote Repo : It is coming from remote site (internet)

At first, the repository will be checked in local repo.
if it is not present, checks in central else in remote.

    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>

Once you add the dependency,
