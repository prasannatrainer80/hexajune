Forms in angular allows you to accept input from the user, and perform validations and business operations. 

There are various types of forms in angular as 

1) Template Driven Forms : Ensures code to be written by using Two-Way binding, [(ngModel)], and less operations on ts file.

Pros : 
_______

	-> Easy to use
	-> Suitable for simple scenarios
	-> Not recommended for complex scenarios
	-> Need to depend on two way binding
	-> Minimal component code
	-> Automatic track of form and its data
	-> Templates are validated via directives
	-> Data model is un-structured
	-> Predictability in template for is asynchronous
	-> Form validation, as we add more validator tags to a field or
		when we start adding complex cross-field validations the
		readability of the form decreases

Angular Validations, we have various form states known as 

1) Pristine : The user has not modified by form control value

2) Dirty : The user has modified the form control

3) Touched : The user has interacted with the form control, e.g. by clicking or focusing on it.

4) Untouched : The form control has not been interacted with by the user

5) Valid : The form controls value meets the validation rules 

2) Model Driven Forms
