is this code works or any error in this 

error is into statement missing

       dbms_output.put_line('Total Records ' || total_records);
   end;


Stored Procedures :
____________________

What is syntax to create stored procedure

Create or replace procedure procedure_name(par(s)) 
AS
BEGINE
END;

Create or replace procedure prcSayHello
AS
BEGIN
        dbms_output.put_line('Welcome to PL/SQL Stored Procedure...');
END;

To Execute sp

exec prcSayHello;

How to create procedure with parameters

Create or replace procedure prcEmploySearch(eno employ.empno%type)
AS
BEGIN
     Declare
        nam employ.name%type;
        dpt employ.dept%type;
        dsg employ.desig%type;
        bas employ.basic%type;
     begin
        select Name, Dept, Desig, Basic into Nam, dpt, dsg, bas 
		from Employ where empno = eno;
        dbms_output.put_line('Employ No  ' || eno);
        dbms_output.put_line('Employ Name ' || nam);
        dbms_output.put_line('Department ' || dpt);
        dbms_output.put_line('Designation ' || dsg);
        dbms_output.put_line('Basic  ' || bas);
     end;
END;

How to Create a procedure with in and out parameters

Create or Replace procedure prcEmpSal
(
   eno IN employ.empno%type,
   bas OUT employ.basic%type
)
AS
BEGIN
    select basic into bas from Employ where empno = eno;
END;
_________________________________________________________________________________________

Create or replace procedure prcEmpOut(eno employ.empno%type)
AS
BEGIN
     declare
         bas employ.basic%type;
     begin
         prcEmpSal(eno,bas);
         dbms_output.put_line('Salary is ' || bas);
     end;
END;

exec prcEmpOut(1);

If a procedure is having output parameter, it must be executed from 
another procedure or batch

directly we cannot call them.

What is Trigger ???

What is a database trigger?
Types of Triggers
Creating a database trigger 
Correlation names
Instead-of triggers
Knowing which command fired the trigger
Enabling and disabling trigger
Dropping a trigger

What is a Database Trigger?
Database trigger is a PL/SQL block that is executed on an event in the database.  The event is related to a particular data manipulation of a table such as inserting, deleting or updating a row of a table. 
 
Triggers may be used for any of the following:

To implement complex business rule, which cannot be implemented using integrity constraints.
To audit the process.  For example, to keep track of changes made to a table. 
To automatically perform an action when another concerned action takes place.  For example, updating a table whenever there is an insertion or a row into another  table.

1) Which database objects are automatically executed or fired when some event occurs

Trigger

2) Triggers can be created on 

Table View Schema All the above

All the above

3) What are the type of triggers are there for execution

BEFORE
AFTER
INSTEAD OF

4) Which specifies the columns name that will be updated

OF COL_NAME

5) Triggers can get data from Old values and Updated values how can we make it

Old values can be accessable by using old as 

old:city old:state old:salary

updated values can be accesable by using new keyword as

new:city, new:state, new:salary


Old and New references are available for triggers at row level

they are not available at table level.

6) What are the benefits of triggers

   -> Generate values automatically
   -> Enforing Security
   -> Enforing Referential integrity
   -> Event Logging and storing information on table access

7) Triggers can be executed on 
	DDL
	DML
	Database Operation

8) If you want to create trigger on view please use instead of trigger

9) You can specify table name of trigger to be created by using ON TABLE_NAME
option

Sytanax to create trigger

CREATE  [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigername
{BEFORE | AFTER}
{DELETE | INSERT | UPDATE [OF columns]}
        [OR {DELETE | INSERT |UPDATE [OF columns]}]... 
ON table
[FOR EACH ROW [WHEN condition]]
[REFERENCING  [OLD AS old] [NEW AS new]]
PL/SQL block

10) ON which command we cannot create triggers

SELECT command

11) How to specify row level triggers

FOR EACH ROW

12) Will trigger accepts parameters ???

Strictly NO

13) how to execute Stored Procedure

exec procedure_name

14) Can we pass parameters in stored procedure

we can pass both input and output parametgers

15) Stored Procedures will return values (Yes)

16) Stored Procedures will not be used in transaction (Yes)

17) Stored Procedures not to be used in select and where clause

18) Stored Procedures will enahance efficiency, reusability, and security

19) what operations are suppored in stored procedures INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE,SELECT
